Radiation patterns of this antenna are exceptionally well controlled, further adding to the performance of the antenna.
The XPOL-2-5G antenna includes the newer 3400 – 4200 MHz bands, which were not previously covered by our V2 and is suitable for 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G. This antenna performs exceptionally well in the following frequency bands: 617 – 960 MHz, 1710 – 2170 MHz, 2300 – 2700 MHz & 3400 – 4200 MHz in addition to the new bands, the gain in the 1700 MHz and 2.7 GHz is around 3 dB higher than the “V2” over the same frequency bands! Our “V2” antenna already outperformed most competitors over these bands, so this substantial improvement in gain shows the benefits of the new advanced materials and novel radiator design.
So, if it was a car, we installed an entirely new technology engine producing twice the power under the bonnet – it may look the same, but just wait until you turn the ignition on!

The four cellular MIMO antennas (for 2G/3G/4G) covers the contemporary 617 MHz to 2700 MHz bands, as well as the new emerging LTE and 5G spectrum for 450MHz and 3.5GHz CBRS bands, which is becoming popular across the various international cellular network operators for LTE. The ultra-wideband performance of the antenna allows it to be used across different operators and technologies and is ready for future cellular technologies up to 3.8 GHz for 5G applications. The fifth antenna is a high-performance active GPS/GLONASS system operating down to -40°C. The MIMO-3-14 exceeds the performance of most competitors due to the attention to the design of this high-performance antenna. The radiation patterns of all radiating elements provide an excellent balance between omnidirectionality, pattern diversity and good radiation abilities at the desired elevation. This is an important criterion for the transportation and marine market, which the antenna was specifically designed for. Main applications are for commercial/industrial vehicles, marine, M2M and other IoT systems using a wide range of radio technologies, while remaining futureproof over the wide frequency band.

The antenna enclosure effectively looks the same as the second generation “V2” but has been completely redesigned on the inside. We have used advanced metamaterial technology, making use of Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC) and new registered/patent pending radiator configuration, which is proving to yield exceptional improvements in bandwidth and gain. Radiation patterns of this antenna are exceptionally well controlled, further adding to the performance of the antenna.
 The XPOL-2-5G-US antenna includes the 617 to 894 MHz band and the newer 3400 – 3800 MHz bands, which were not previously covered by our V2 and is suitable for 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G. This antenna performs exceptionally well in the following frequency bands: 617 – 894 MHz, 1710 – 2170 MHz, 2300 – 2700 MHz & 3400 – 3800 MHz. In addition to the new bands, the gain in the 1700 MHz and 2.7 GHz is around 3 dB higher than the “V2” over the same frequency bands! Our “V2” antenna already outperformed most competitors over these bands, so this substantial improvement in gain shows the benefits of the new advanced materials and novel radiator design.
 So, if it was a car, we installed an entirely new technology engine producing twice the power under the bonnet – it may look the same, but just wait until you turn the ignition on!

 Ultra-versatile mounting options for easy installation","Poynting’s new PUCK range offers a small profile antenna for use in the IoT/M2M, Smart Meter, Smart Utilities, Transportation, Marine and the Agricultural/Farming markets. The PUCK-7 consists of a 4-in-1 antenna system within a single housing, featuring 2×2 MIMO LTE/5G and 2×2 MIMO Wi-Fi (Dual-band 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz). The 2x Cellular MIMO antennas (for 2G/3G/4G) cover the 617 MHz to 4200 MHz band, this includes the most popular international LTE/5G bands. The antenna provides two separate dual-band Wi-Fi antennas offering concurrent 2.4 GHz and 5 to 7.2 GHz bands, capable of 802.11n and 802.11ac/ax with 2×2 MIMO. The PUCK exceeds the performance of many competitors due to the attention to design of this high-performance antenna. The radiation patterns of all radiating elements provide an excellent balance between omnidirectionality, pattern diversity and good radiation abilities at the desired elevation, which is often overlooked in such a small size antenna. Despite its small size, this antenna provides excellent performance especially at the higher frequency bands, where performance is critical for LTE throughput and connection stability. This antenna is designed so that both the LTE ports are connected to the router/device to ensure the best performance. Please see other derivatives of the PUCK range that are more suitable for a SISO application.

 The HELI-42 is a dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna, radiating in both directions (i.e., bi-directional). This makes them ideal for the coverage of both Wi-Fi bands in mining and other type of tunnels. These antennas are typically used for the deployment of IoT within the tunnel to provide telemetry and mining automation. These antennas are available in both Left-hand Circular (LHC) & Right-Hand Circular (RHC) polarised antenna elements to provide optimal decorrelation within a 4×4 MIMO or even 8×8 MIMO deployment when using the BRKT-46, resulting in optimum performance. The antenna decorrelation is due to the polarisation difference and spatial diversity, between the two antenna elements, which enhances MIMO performance and RF reliability within a mining tunnel. The dual-band Wi-Fi connection propagates around tunnel bends in a Non-Line of Sight scenario and provides immunity to many Wi-Fi signal disrupting objects such as trains and drilling machinery which appear to obscure the tunnel.

The antenna is fitted between an indoor router unit and an outdoor antenna. The purpose of the antenna is to leak a small amount of the transmit or received signal into the region where the unit is installed. This enables indoor users to receive an improved signal whilst most of the power is radiated by the antenna outside. 
 The unit has a wideband operation and operates from 698 – 6000 MHz, covering the popular 5G/LTE bands as well as the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for Wi-Fi applications. The UDAS has an omni-directional radiation pattern, which ensures that the whole room or enclosed space is covered. The UDAS also offers 2×2 MIMO, where the antenna elements within the enclosure are cross-polarised, as this helps with diversity and delivers improved performance. The UDAS enclosure is made of ABS with UV stabiliser, which is a high impact resistant plastic and is also resistant to acids and other chemicals.
