    "description": " New advanced metamaterial technology \n Exceptional performance over the main 4G/5G bands\n High Gain for the antenna size\n Wideband 2x2 MIMO 4G/5G antenna\n Backwards compatible 2G/3G/4G/LTE/5G antenna\n Two cross polarised antennas in one enclosure for optimal LTE performance\n IP65 weather/dust and vandal resistant enclosure.",
    "productOverview": "The XPOL-2-5G is Poynting’s third generation “V3” of this very popular Cross Polarised (XPOL), cellular band, 2×2 MIMO antenna. The antenna enclosure effectively looks the same as the second generation “V2” but has been completely redesigned on the inside. We have used advanced metamaterial technology, making use of Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC) and new registered/patent pending radiator configuration, which is proving to yield exceptional improvements in bandwidth and gain. Radiation patterns of this antenna are exceptionally well controlled, further adding to the performance of the antenna.\nThe XPOL-2-5G antenna includes the newer 3400 – 4200 MHz bands, which were not previously covered by our V2 and is suitable for 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G. This antenna performs exceptionally well in the following frequency bands: 617 – 960 MHz, 1710 – 2170 MHz, 2300 – 2700 MHz & 3400 – 4200 MHz in addition to the new bands, the gain in the 1700 MHz and 2.7 GHz is around 3 dB higher than the “V2” over the same frequency bands! Our “V2” antenna already outperformed most competitors over these bands, so this substantial improvement in gain shows the benefits of the new advanced materials and novel radiator design.\nSo, if it was a car, we installed an entirely new technology engine producing twice the power under the bonnet – it may look the same, but just wait until you turn the ignition on!\n",

The antennas can therefore be used to resolve channel saturation and provide the ultimate in Wi-Fi performance and flexibility. This means that the antenna can be used for point to point links where there is an abundance of RF noise and cluttered environments.\n The antenna operates in the two Wi-Fi frequency bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), offering excellent utilization of the radio spectrum. The antenna has a maximum gain of 13dBi in the 2.4GHz band and 18dBi in the 5GHz band, which offers the best performance with reliable connections. The antenna also covers the 3.5 GHz CBRS band, which will be used for future 5G technologies with a peak gain of 15dBi. The housing is made of ABS which is a high impact resistant plastic and is also resistant to acids and other chemicals that may occur in industrial plants. The antenna can be opened on the side where an SMA female connector is placed. You can then feed the cable through the bypass gland, which means you do not have to join the antenna cable to extension cables. This eliminates connector losses and the need for taping and waterproofing the connectors for an outdoor installation.\n",

The four cellular MIMO antennas (for 2G/3G/4G) covers the contemporary 617 MHz to 2700 MHz bands, as well as the new emerging LTE and 5G spectrum for 450MHz and 3.5GHz CBRS bands, which is becoming popular across the various international cellular network operators for LTE. The ultra-wideband performance of the antenna allows it to be used across different operators and technologies and is ready for future cellular technologies up to 3.8 GHz for 5G applications. The fifth antenna is a high-performance active GPS/GLONASS system operating down to -40°C. The MIMO-3-14 exceeds the performance of most competitors due to the attention to the design of this high-performance antenna. The radiation patterns of all radiating elements provide an excellent balance between omnidirectionality, pattern diversity and good radiation abilities at the desired elevation. This is an important criterion for the transportation and marine market, which the antenna was specifically designed for. Main applications are for commercial/industrial vehicles, marine, M2M and other IoT systems using a wide range of radio technologies, while remaining futureproof over the wide frequency band.\n",

    "productOverview": "The XPOL-2-5G-US is Poynting’s third generation “V3” of this very popular Cross Polarised (XPOL), cellular band, 2X2 MIMO antenna. The antenna enclosure effectively looks the same as the second generation “V2” but has been completely redesigned on the inside. We have used advanced metamaterial technology, making use of Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC) and new registered/patent pending radiator configuration, which is proving to yield exceptional improvements in bandwidth and gain. Radiation patterns of this antenna are exceptionally well controlled, further adding to the performance of the antenna.\n The XPOL-2-5G-US antenna includes the 617 to 894 MHz band and the newer 3400 – 3800 MHz bands, which were not previously covered by our V2 and is suitable for 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G. This antenna performs exceptionally well in the following frequency bands: 617 – 894 MHz, 1710 – 2170 MHz, 2300 – 2700 MHz & 3400 – 3800 MHz. In addition to the new bands, the gain in the 1700 MHz and 2.7 GHz is around 3 dB higher than the “V2” over the same frequency bands! Our “V2” antenna already outperformed most competitors over these bands, so this substantial improvement in gain shows the benefits of the new advanced materials and novel radiator design.\n So, if it was a car, we installed an entirely new technology engine producing twice the power under the bonnet – it may look the same, but just wait until you turn the ignition on!\n",

    "productOverview": "The HELI-22 forms part of a series of Mini-HELI antennas. These antennas are only mini in size relative to their bigger brothers, the HELI-3, HELI-4 & HELI-8, but offer medium to high gain, which makes these antennas ideal for mining tunnels where IoT/M2M connectivity is deployed and can also be used for coverage into the stopes.\nThe HELI-22 is a dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna, radiating in both directions (i.e. bi-directional). This makes them ideal for the coverage of both Wi-Fi bands in mining and other type of tunnels. These antennas are typically used for the deployment of IoT within the tunnel to provide telemetry and mine automation. These antennas are available in both Left Hand Circular (LHC) & Right-Hand Circular (RHC) polarised antenna elements to provide optimal decorrelation within a MIMO deployment when using the BRKT-45, resulting in optimum performance. The decorrelation is due to the polarisation difference and spatial diversity, between the two antenna elements, which enhances MIMO performance and RF reliability within a mining tunnel. The dual-band Wi-Fi connection propagates around tunnel bends in a Non-Line of Sight scenario and provides immunity to many Wi-Fi signal disrupting objects such as trains and drilling machinery which appear to obscure the tunnel.\n",

Multiple dual-band antennas can resolve channel saturation and provide the ultimate in Wi-Fi performance and flexibility. This 4×4 MIMO antenna has 4 different antenna orientations in one enclosure. This means the antenna can be used in a 2×2, 3×3 and if necessary, a 4×4 antenna configuration. \n The wide beamwidth ensures good coverage in offices, halls and factories etc. The antenna operates in the two Wi-Fi frequency bands 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, offering excellent utilization of the radio spectrum. The antenna has 9 dBi gain in the 2.4 GHz band and 11 dBi gain in the 5 GHz band, which offers the best performance with a reliable connection. The housing is made of ABS which is a high impact resistant plastic and is also resistant to acids and other chemicals that may occur in industrial plants. \n The antenna can be opened on the side where the 4 x SMA female connectors are placed. The cable can be fed through the bypass gland, which eliminates the joint to the antenna extension cables. This eliminates connector losses and the need for taping and waterproofing the connectors for an outdoor installation. This antenna is designed for installations where 4×4 (four independent streams), multiplexing time-space technologies is needed. It can be used indoors or outdoors and is ideal for use in warehouses, production facilities, building sites or any other environment that requires Wi-Fi connectivity, such as computers, mobile phones, tablets, and any other IoT devices.\n",

    "productOverview": "The HELI-41 forms part of the Mini-HELI antenna series. These antennas are only mini in size relative to their bigger brothers, the HELI-3, HELI-4 & HELI-8, but offer medium to high gain, which makes these antennas ideal for mining tunnels where IoT/M2M connectivity is deployed and can also be used for coverage into the stopes.\n The HELI-41 is a dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi antenna, radiating in a single direction (i.e., uni-directional). This makes them ideal for the coverage of both Wi-Fi bands in mining and other type of tunnels. These antennas are typically used for the deployment of IoT within the tunnel to provide telemetry and mining automation. These antennas are available in both Left-hand Circular (LHC) & Right-Hand Circular (RHC) polarised antenna elements to provide optimal decorrelation within a 4×4 MIMO or even 8×8 MIMO deployment when using the BRKT-46, resulting in optimum performance. The antenna decorrelation is due to the polarisation difference and spatial diversity, between the two antenna elements, which enhances MIMO performance and RF reliability within a mining tunnel. The dual-band Wi-Fi connection propagates around tunnel bends in a Non-Line of Sight scenario and provides immunity to many Wi-Fi signal disrupting objects such as trains and drilling machinery which appear to obscure the tunnel.\n",

The antenna is fitted between an indoor router unit and an outdoor antenna. The purpose of the antenna is to leak a small amount of the transmit or received signal into the region where the unit is installed. This enables indoor users to receive an improved signal whilst most of the power is radiated by the antenna outside. \n The unit has a wideband operation and operates from 698 – 6000 MHz, covering the popular 5G/LTE bands as well as the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for Wi-Fi applications. The UDAS has an omni-directional radiation pattern, which ensures that the whole room or enclosed space is covered. The UDAS also offers 2×2 MIMO, where the antenna elements within the enclosure are cross-polarised, as this helps with diversity and delivers improved performance. The UDAS enclosure is made of ABS with UV stabiliser, which is a high impact resistant plastic and is also resistant to acids and other chemicals.\n",

    "productOverview": "The HELI-17 forms part of a series of Mini-HELI antennas. These antennas are only mini in size relative to their bigger brothers, the HELI-3, HELI-4 & HELI-8, but offer medium to high gain, which makes these antennas ideal for mining tunnels where IoT/M2M connectivity is deployed and can also be used for coverage into the stopes.\nThe HELI-17 is a set of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi antennas, radiating in both directions (i.e. bi-directional), which make them ideal for the coverage of the 2.4 GHz in mining and other type of tunnels. These antennas are typically used for the deployment of IoT within the tunnel to provide telemetry and mine automation. These antennas are available in both Left Hand Circular (LHC) & Right-Hand Circular (RHC) polarised antenna elements to provide optimal decorrelation within a MIMO deployment when using the BRKT-45, resulting in optimum performance. The decorrelation is due to the polarisation difference and spatial diversity, between the two antenna elements, which enhances MIMO performance and RF reliability within a mining tunnel. The Wi-Fi connection propagates around tunnel bends in a Non-Line of Sight scenario and provides immunity to many Wi-Fi signal disrupting objects such as trains and drilling machinery which appear to obscure the tunnel.\n",

    "description": " Circular polarised HELI antenna provides enhanced signal propagation and connection stability within a tunnel\n Uni-directional – radiates in one direction in a tunnel\n Covers Wi-Fi band from 2400 – 2500 MHz\n Careful mechanical design provides ruggedness, water and dust resistance (IP 65)\n Ideal for Mining & Tunnel M2M and Wi-Fi deployments\n Easy installation with eye-bolts for ceiling use and ground plane",
    "productOverview": "The HELI-4 is a high gain, uni-directional antenna which complements our Wi-Fi MinePoynt tunnel and mine antennas. The combination of MinePoynt beam antennas, for long distance thru-tunnel links, with this directional antenna, exploits Poynting’s fifteen years’ experience in designing and manufacturing antennas for underground mining data networks. The tunnel antenna is the ideal antenna for 2.4 – 2.5 GHz wireless applications in tunnels. In tests, both the data rate and range achieved with this antenna was greater than obtained when using linearly polarized panel antennas of the same gain. The hardy construction of this antenna makes it ideal for the mining environment. HELI-4 is a uni-directional antenna whilst the closely related HELI-8 is a bi-directional antenna. The HELI-4 gives you a low-cost network infrastructure for current voice and data needs in mines and tunnels.\n",
