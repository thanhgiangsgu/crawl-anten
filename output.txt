The antenna enclosure effectively looks the same as the second generation “V2” but has been completely redesigned on the inside. We have used advanced metamaterial technology, making use of Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC) and new registered/patent pending radiator configuration, which is proving to yield exceptional improvements in bandwidth and gain. Radiation patterns of this antenna are exceptionally well controlled, further adding to the performance of the antenna.\nThe XPOL-2-5G antenna includes the newer 3400 – 4200 MHz bands, which were not previously covered by our V2 and is suitable for 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G. This antenna performs exceptionally well in the following frequency bands: 617 – 960 MHz, 1710 – 2170 MHz, 2300 – 2700 MHz & 3400 – 4200 MHz in addition to the new bands, the gain in the 1700 MHz and 2.7 GHz is around 3 dB higher than the “V2” over the same frequency bands! Our “V2” antenna already outperformed most competitors over these bands, so this substantial improvement in gain shows the benefits of the new advanced materials and novel radiator design.\nSo, if it was a car, we installed an entirely new technology engine producing twice the power under the bonnet – it may look the same, but just wait until you turn the ignition on!\n"},{"fullName":"Wideband Log-Periodic Dipole Array Antenna","shortName":"LPDA-92","textInner":"The LPDA Enclosure","productLink":"https://poynting.tech/antennas/lpda-92/","parameter":"698 - 3800 MHz, 11dBi","description":" Futureproof wideband LTE and Wi-Fi antenna covering 698 – 3800 MHz\n Compatible with 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies\n Covers the CBRS Band from 3.2 GHz to 3.8 GHz\nImproves mobile network subscriber’s user experience\nWeather- and vandal resistant\nUsed in extreme weather environment","productOverview":"This high-gain, wideband, directional antenna covers all international cellular, mobile and wireless data bands including GSM 900/ GSM1800/UMTS/LTE bands.
