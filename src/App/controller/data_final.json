    "description": "  The Pasternack PEANRBD1036 antenna is an omni antenna  operating from 860 MHz to 870 MHz with 1 dBi gain. Our  high-quality rubber duck antenna transmits high power  signals, increasing the signal strength, thus providing  improved coverage, better broadcast control, and faster  speed. The SMA male connector on this monopole antenna  enables it to be used vertically, at a right angle, or at  any angle in between.\n                    This PEANRBD1036 stubby antenna is 0.37 inches wide, 2.01  inches long, and 0.37 inches tall. Pasternack’s  omnidirectional antenna has a maximum input VSWR of 2:1,  which results in the best power transfer and reduced losses.  This omnidirectional antenna has a linear polarization, an  SMA male connector, and an ABS radome material. Our black  antenna functions between -40 to 65 degrees C and has 50 Ohm  impedance.\n                    The Pasternack antenna is ideal for public safety, security,  construction, wireless communications, IOT sensors, IOT  trackers, wireless microphones, industrial monitoring and  data transmission, remote control, and amateur radio.
